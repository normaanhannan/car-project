# Car Application


There are many different kinds of cars out there nowadays. 
You are to design a program which will give user option to know a bit more details about each kind of car. 
To write this program you are required to follow the requirement as listed in ReadMe.md


####Requirements:

     1. There are many kinds of cars. Some are electric, some are diesel and some are gas-operated. Implement a fuel type behavior and override for each kind with proper fuel they take. 
     2. All car runs. So, implement a run behavior and inherit from a superclass. All cars now have built-in GPS. So, include a hasGps method in the superclass as well.
     3. Your program should only handle three kinds of cars: Tesla, Lexas, and BMW. Whereas Tesla is electric, Lexas is gas operated and BMW is diesel.
     4. You are required to use the following Java types:
        a. Interface
        b. Abstract class
        c. Concrete class
        d. Enum
        e. Static method
        f. Inheritance
        g. Exception handling
     5. Ask user for input of what which kind of car they want to know about.
     6. Handle all possible scenarios that can break your application. Your program should never print out any exception in the console. Handle all exception properly.

        
        
        ** You can also use any other components of java outside of these kinds mentioned above. 
        While designing and writing code keep the following things in mind:
        1. Code formatting. Treat your code as good handwriting.
        2. DRY (Do not repeat yourself)
        3. Do not hard-code values.
